===========================================
redbKIT INSTALLATION
===========================================

Pre-requisites
--------------

For the basic installation, you need:
-> a reasonably recent version of Matlab
-> a supported C compiler, see e.g. http://it.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2016a/
   (gcc on Unix and gcc/clang on Mac OS X work smoothly)

If you want to speed-up matrix assembly via multithreading, you also need:
-> a C compiler with OpenMP support, see e.g. http://it.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2016a/
   (gcc is tested for both Unix and Mac OS X)

If you want to speed-up Matlab built-in "sparse" command by installing the FAST package,
you also need:
-> a supported C compiler for the serial version
-> a C compiler with OpenMP support for the multithreaded version

If you want to use parallel Additive Schwarz preconditioners, you also need
-> MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox
-> CMake


Basic Installation
------------------

Open Matlab and navigate to redbKIT root directory. Then type 

>> make

to compile the C-assembly routines and "mexify" some other files.


Installation with OpenMP enabled
--------------------------------

Open Matlab and navigate to redbKIT root directory. Then type 

>> make(1)

to compile the C-assembly routines with OpenMP enabled.


Install Metis for Additive Schwarz preconditioners
--------------------------------------------------

Open Matlab and navigate to the redbKIT directory FEM_library/Mesh
Then type 

>> install_metismex


Install FAST to speed-up Matlab "sparse" command
--------------------------------------------------

Open Matlab and navigate to the redbKIT directory FEM_library/Tools.

To install the serial version, type
>> install_FAST

To install the multithreaded version, type
>> install_FAST(1)

In both cases you will be required to accept FAST's license.
