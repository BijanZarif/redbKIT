{"name":"redbKIT","tagline":"a MATLAB library for reduced-order modeling of parametrized PDEs","body":"redbKIT is a [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) library (developed at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) - [Chair of Modeling and Scientific Computing](http://cmcs.epfl.ch/)) which implements some Reduced Basis (RB) methods for parametrized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In particular, it includes straightforward implementations of many of the algorithms presented in the book\r\n\r\n>[**[QMN15] A. Quarteroni, A. Manzoni, F. Negri. Reduced Basis Methods for Partial Differential Equations. An Introduction**, Springer, 2015.](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319154305#aboutBook)\r\n\r\n`redbKIT` consists of three main packages: [`RB_library`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/RB_library), [`FEM_library`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/FEM_library) and [`Problems`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/Problems), which are briefly described below.\r\n\r\n#### RB_library\r\n\r\nImplements in the MATLAB language many of the algorithms and methods presented in Chapters 3, 6, 7 and 10 of the book **[QMN15]**, such as\r\n- proper orthogonal decomposition\r\n- the greedy algorithm\r\n- radial basis function interpolation of stability factors\r\n- Galerkin and least-squares reduced basis methods\r\n- the empirical interpolation method\r\n\r\nThe implementation is almost independent of the underlying high-fidelity approximation, provided that the high-fidelity model is described in a specified format. Here, we rely on the finite element method as high-fidelity approximation. See below.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### FEM_library\r\nProvides a flexible implementation of the finite element method for two-dimensional, stationary  advection-diffusion-reaction PDEs. The package can load linear triangular meshes either in the .msh format or in the [MATLAB Partial Differential Equation Toolbox(R)](http://www.mathworks.com/products/pde/index.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop) format. Results can be either visualized in MATLAB or exported in the [VTK format](http://www.vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf) for post-processing with [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/).\r\n\r\n#### Problems\r\nContains a gallery of examples and applications. Many of them are described in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 of the book **[QMN15]**.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload and Installation\r\n-------\r\n\r\nYou can directly [**`download the current release`**](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/archive/master.zip) or clone the git repository\r\n\r\n\t$ git clone https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT.git /folder_path\r\n\r\n\r\n`redbKIT` contains the following files and folders\r\n\r\n[`FEM_library/`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/FEM_library)  [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/blob/master/LICENSE)  [`Problems/`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/Problems)  [`RB_library/`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/RB_library)  [`README.md`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/blob/master/README.md)  [`setPath.m`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/blob/master/setPath.m)\r\n\r\nTo check that your operating system and MATLAB installation are supported, and that the code is correctly working, please follow these instructions. Start MATLAB and navigate to the `redbKIT` folder. Then, type in the MATLAB prompt\r\n\r\n\t>> setPath\r\n\t>> cd Problems\r\n\t>> test_all\r\n\r\nThe `test_all.m` functions launches a series of tests and generates a log file `test_log.txt`. If all the tests are marked as *passed*, you can start enjoying `redbKIT`. Otherwise, do not hesitate to contact us by email at <redbkit@gmail.com>.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-------\r\n\r\nStart MATLAB(R) and navigate to the `redbKIT` folder. Then, type in the MATLAB prompt\r\n\r\n\t>> setPath\r\n\r\nto add the [`FEM_library/`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/FEM_library) and [`RB_library/`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/RB_library) folders to the current path.\r\nA welcome message should appear: you can now start using redbKIT!\r\n\r\nA gallery of applications is provided in the folder [`Problems/`](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT/tree/master/Problems).\r\n\r\nIf you want to speedup the finite element assembling operations, you can \"mexify\" the function\r\n`ADR_mex_assembler.m` by running the following command in the MATLAB prompt ([`MATLAB Coder`](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder/?refresh=true) needed):\r\n\r\n\t>> coder -build FEM_library/ADR_assembly.prj\r\n\r\nThen replace `ADR_mex_assembler` with `ADR_mex_assembler_mex` at line 109\r\nof `Assembler_2D.m`\r\n\r\nAn HTML documentation of redbKIT can be automatically generated using [`M2HTML`](http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/). To this end, you should download, extract and add to the path [`M2HTML`](http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/) using the following commands:\r\n\r\n\t>> url_M2HTML = 'http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/m2html.zip';\r\n\t>> unzip(url_M2HTML);\r\n\t>> addpath(genpath(strcat(pwd,'/m2html')));\r\n\r\nThen generate the documentation\r\n\r\n\t>> m2html('mfiles',{'RB_library', 'RB_library/RBF_interpolation' 'FEM_library'}, ...\r\n\t   'htmldir','Documentation', 'recursive','off', 'global','on',...\r\n\t   'template','frame', 'index','menu', 'graph','on');\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n**redbKIT is distributed under BSD 2-clause license**\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\r\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\r\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\r\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\r\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
